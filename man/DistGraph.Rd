\title{
Compute the vertex pair distance matrix for a graph
}
\description{
Compute the distances between pairs of vertices in a graph, using a shortest path, diffusion kernel, or mean first-passage time-based measure. 
}
\usage{
DistGraph(g, v=V(g), edge.attr=NULL, dist.method=c("shortest.paths", "diffusion", "mfpt"), 
correct.inf=TRUE, correct.factor=1, verbose=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{g}{
\code{igraph} object, the graph on which to work.
}
  \item{v}{
\code{igraph} object or numeric vector, the vertices from which each distance is calculated. 
}
  \item{edge.attr}{
String, the name of the edge attribute to be used as distances along the edges. If \code{NULL}, then each edge is assumed to have a distance of 1. Smaller edge distances denote stronger interactions between vertex pairs.
}
  \item{dist.method}{
String, the method used to compute the distance between each vertex pair.
}
  \item{correct.inf}{
Logical, if \code{TRUE} then infinite vertex pair distances are replaced with distances equal to the maximum distance measured across the network, multiplied by \code{correct.factor}.
}
\item{correct.factor}{
Numeric value, if the graph contains unconnected vertices, then the distance between these vertices is set as the maximum distance between the connected vertices multiplied by \code{correct.factor}.
}
  \item{verbose}{
Logical, if \code{TRUE} messages about the progress of the function are displayed. 
}

\details{
This function computes a distance matrix for a graph. Different methods can be used to calculate the distance between each pair of vertices. If a set of vertices is specified, a smaller distance matrix containing only vertices corresponding to the vertices is returned.

Descriptions of how the shortest paths (\code{shortest.paths}), diffusion kernel-based (\code{GraphDiffusion}) and mean first-passage time (\code{GraphMFPT}) distance measures work are given in their respective function descriptions.
}
\value{
Numeric matrix, containing the distances between vertex pairs.
